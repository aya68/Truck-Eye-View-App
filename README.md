# Truck-Eye-View-App
Read Me For instructions. Overview: This is an app with 3 simple components, a menu screen, A part to learn and one part to drive around in a lifelike simulation of NYC. We used Unity to Develop the app making use of the libraries and free assets Unity provides. Languages used: C# 100% Scripts and functions: Files and description, there is documentation within the code with every function to demonstrate how it works. exampleMove.cs : This script generally takes care of the movement of the truck and any other functionality of the truck like seatbelt check. Basically it takes values from the user in the form of 1/-1, when they press buttons which tell the car it should move forward or backwards. Variable motor is the most important in this piece of code as the value of the motor determines where the object will end up in the 3D plane. The script takes colliders and wheel meshes as parameters/objects that it modifies. Which can be provided to the script with a simple drag and drop from Unity. Transformation part of the object is inside a function that is called every frame. Fact.cs : menuSceneChange.cs: simple 1 line script to change scenes changeImage.cs: This is a simple script with a bunch of if statements, which loops through cases when the button is pressed and presents the next sprite/image. menuSceneChange.cs: 1 line script to move from menu scene to movePhysicsNYC scene. Audio.cs: This script was pre written has a lot of comments on how it works. Basically it takes an object, in this example our truck object, and applies a simple sound track to it. Installation:
